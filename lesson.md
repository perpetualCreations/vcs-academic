# Electricity Lesson
## REV 1.0, 2021-04-29

Electricity is the natural behavior of electron flow and electric charges.
Commonly experienced in daily life, when interacting with machines that rely on electrical phenomenon to function, human society relies on its existence to operate.

In this lesson, you will review the following concepts,

* [Voltage, Resistance, and Current](##vrc)
* [Ohm's Law](##ol)
* [Parts of a Basic Circuit](##pbc)
* [Types of Circuits, and Circuit Analysis](#tcca)

## <a name="vrc"></a>Voltage, Resistance, and Current
Voltage, resistance, and current are properties of current flow.
They can be attributed as follows,

* Voltage - pressure of current flow
* Current - volume of current flow
* Resistance - resistance against current flow

In subsequent sections, how these values are correlated to components in a circuit, and how they can predictably change, will be reviewed.

For an analogy of these properties, current flow can be metaphorized as a river, where the force of the river is voltage,
the amount of water running through it the current, and the force acting against the river water, resistance.

## <a name="ol"></a>Ohm's Law
Equation formula,

```math
V=IR
```

...is known as Ohm's Law. It dictates the relationship between voltage (V), current (I), and resistance (R).

With algebra, you can solve for any of the three variables so long the other two are provided.
This will be heavily used in the section regarding circuit analysis.

Rearranging to solve for current and resistance,
```
V/R=I
V/I=R
```

Feel free to refer back to this section as reference.
